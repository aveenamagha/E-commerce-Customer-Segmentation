# E-commerce-Customer-Segmentation

# Project Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation for an e-commerce platform using the K-means clustering algorithm. By analyzing customer behaviors such as the number of orders and searches for different brands, we grouped customers into distinct clusters. The goal is to understand customer preferences and improve marketing strategies.

# Problem Statement

Given the e-commerce customer data, the task is to apply K-means clustering to group customers with similar interests, helping businesses target specific customer segments effectively.

# Approach

Data Cleaning:
Cleaned a dataset of 30,000 rows by handling missing values and ensuring consistency in the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted data visualization to identify trends and relationships between customer behaviors.

Clustering (K-means):
Applied the K-means clustering algorithm.
Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
Achieved the best clustering with 3 clusters.

Model Visualization:
Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize the clusters in a 2D space.
Generated scatter plots and charts to interpret customer segments.
# Key Highlights
 
Cleaned and pre-processed 30,000 rows of e-commerce customer data.
Segmented customers into 3 distinct groups using K-means clustering.
Visualized the clusters using PCA for better interpretation.

# Tools and Libraries Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of K-means clustering for customer segmentation in e-commerce. The insights gained can help businesses improve their targeting and sales strategies by focusing on the specific needs of different customer segments.
